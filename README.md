# Edusity

A simple react JS landing page project.
The contact us section on the page is functional, as the https://web3forms.com/ API is in use.

## Run the app locally

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
3. Create a .env file and give it the following variables:

- **VITE_API_URL**: web3forms API url,
- **VITE_API_KEY**: your API key.

4. Run `npm run dev` to start the server.
